Code accompanying the UAI 2021 paper 'Deep Kernels with Probabilistic Embeddings for Small-Data Learning'. 

The folders 'Classification' and 'Regression' contain the code for the classification and regression versions of our algorithm respectively. 

Each folder has its own readme file describing how the code is to be run.
